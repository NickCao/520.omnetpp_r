/**
 * Root of the \opp class hierarcy. cObject is a lightweight class, it
 * doesn't contain any data members.
 *
 * Note: In OMNeT++ 2.x and 3.x, cObject was called cPolymorphic.
 * Class cObject in 2.x and 3.x has been renamed to cOwnedObject.
 *
 * It is recommended to use cObject as a base class for any class
 * that has at least one virtual member function. This makes the class more
 * interoperable with \opp, and causes no extra overhead at all.
 * sizeof(cObject) should yield 4 on a 32-bit architecture (4-byte vptr),
 * and using cObject as a base class doesn't add anything to the size
 * of an object, because a class with a virtual function already has a vptr.
 *
 * cObject allows the object to be displayed in graphical user
 * interface (Tkenv) via the getClassName(), info() and detailedInfo() methods
 * which you may choose to redefine in your own subclasses.
 *
 * Using cObject also strengthens type safety. <tt>cObject *</tt>
 * pointers should replace <tt>void *</tt> in most places where you need
 * pointers to "any data structure". Using cObject will allow safe
 * downcasts using <tt>dynamic_cast</tt> and also \opp's
 * <tt>check_and_cast</tt>.
 *
 * Any cObject may become owner of other objects, but owned objects must be
 * subclassed from cOwnedObject.
 *
 * Subclasses are expected to redefine member functions such as dup(),
 * info(), etc.
