	* created platdep/ subdirectory, and factored out most platform 
	dependencies and related utility functions from all parts of 
	OMNeT++/OMNEST to header files in here. Notable exceptions are 
	coroutines (in src/sim) and named pipes	(in src/sim/parsim), where 
	platform differences could not be levelled out by just a few #ifdefs, 
	#defines and inline functions.
