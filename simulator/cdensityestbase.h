/**
 * Common base class for density estimation classes. Provides several
 * pure virtual functions, so it is an abstract class, no instances
 * can be created.
 *
 * For the histogram classes, you need to specify the number of cells
 * and the range. Range can either be set explicitly or you can choose
 * automatic range determination.
 *
 * Automatic range estimation works in the following way:
 * <OL>
 *   <LI>The first <I>num_firstvals</I> observations are stored.
 *   <LI>After having collected a given number of observations, the actual
 *   histogram is set up. The range (<I>min</I>, <I>max</I>) of the
 *   initial values is expanded <I>range_ext_factor</I> times, and
 *   the result will become the histogram's range (<I>rangemin</I>,
 *   <I>rangemax</I>). Based on the range, the cells are layed out.
 *   Then the initial values that have been stored up to this point
 *   will be transferred into the new histogram structure and their
 *   store is deleted -- this is done by the transform() function.
 * </OL>
 *
 * You may also explicitly specify the lower or upper limit and have
 * the other end of the range estimated automatically. The setRange...()
 * member functions of cDensityEstBase deal with setting
 * up the histogram range. It also provides pure virtual functions
 * transform() etc.
 *
 * Subsequent observations are placed in the histogram structure.
 * If an observation falls out of the histogram range, the <I>underflow</I>
 * or the <I>overflow</I> <I>cell</I> is incremented.
 *
 * layout of the histogram:
 * <PRE><TT>
 *        underflow-cell   ordinary cells          overflow-cell
 *       ...----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|--------- ...
 *                    |                             |
