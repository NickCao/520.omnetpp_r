/**
 * Enables traversing the tree of (cObject-rooted) simulation objects.
 * Should be subclassed and the visit() method redefined according
 * to your needs.
 *
 * An example: the cRecursiveObjectFinderVisitor class (internal) has been
 * created to find an object of the given name. The constructor accepts
 * the name of the object to search for, and visit() has been redefined
 * to perform recursive traversal, and to throw EndTraversalException
 * if it finds the given object. The class can be used like this:
 *
 * \code
 * cRecursiveObjectFinderVisitor v(objectName);
 * v.process(root);
 * cObject *result = v.getResult();
 * \endcode
 *
 * The above code will find the root object as well, if its name matches.
 * The second version (below) starts the traversal at the children,
 * so the root object is ignored.
 *
 * \code
 * cRecursiveObjectFinderVisitor v(objectName);
 * v.processChildrenOf(root);
 * cObject *result = v.getResult();
 * \endcode
