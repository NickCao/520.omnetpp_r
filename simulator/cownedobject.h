/**
 * Base class for several classes in the \opp library. Instances of
 * cOwnedObjects are kept track of by the simulation kernel, and
 * may be inserted into cQueue and cArray.
 *
 * It is not always a good idea to subclass your own classes from
 * cOwnedObject, especially if they are small data objects.
 * The more lightweight cObject is often a better choice.
 *
 * When subclassing cOwnedObject, some virtual member functions are
 * expected to be redefined: dup() are mandatory to be redefined, and
 * often you'll want to redefine info() and detailedInfo() as well.
 *
 * <b>Ownership management</b> helps \opp catch common programming
 * errors. As a definition, <i>ownership means the exclusive right and duty
 * to delete owned objects.</i>
 *
 * cOwnedObjects hold a pointer to their owner objects; the getOwner() method returns
 * this pointer. An example will help to understand how it is used:
 *
 *    - when you insert a cMessage into a cQueue, the cQueue will become
 *      the owner of the message, and will set the message's owner to itself.
 *
 *    - a message object can be at one place only at any given time.
 *      When you try to insert the same cMessage again into another (or the same)
 *      cQueue, you'll get an error message that it's already in a cQueue --
 *      sparing you a sure crash later.
 *
 *    - similarly, if you try to send the same message, you'll get an error
 *      message that it cannot be sent because it's still enqueued --
 *      another crash scenario eliminated. Like the previous one, this
 *      test is done by checking the owner pointer in cMessage.
 *
 *    - even if you try to delete the message while it's in the queue,
 *      you'll get an error message instead of just a crash. This is because
 *      cOwnedObject destructor asks for the owner's blessing -- but cQueue will
 *      protest by throwing an exception.
 *
 *    - when you remove the message from the cQueue, the cQueue will "release"
 *      the object; the current module will become the message's "soft" owner,
 *      changing the owner pointer in the message object.
 *
 *    - "soft" owner means that now you can send the message object or insert
 *      it into another cQueue -- the module as a soft owner will let it go.
 *
 *    - the same mechanism can ensure that when a self-message is currently
 *      scheduled (owner is the scheduled-events list) or sent to another module
 *      (owner is the other module) you cannot send or schedule it, or
 *      insert it into a queue. <i>In short: the ownership mechanism is good to your
 *      health.</i>
 *
 *    - when the queue is deleted, it also deletes all objects it contains.
 *      (The cQueue always owns all objects inserted into it -- no exception).
 *
 * The above ownership mechanisms are at work when any cOwnedObject-subclass object
 * gets inserted into any cOwnedObject-subclass container (cQueue, cArray).
 *
 * Some more details, in case you're writing a class that acts as a container:
 *
 *    - you should use the functions take(), drop() on inserting/removing objects
 *    - you should delete the owned objects in the destructor
 *    - the copy constructor of a container should dup() the owned objects
 *      and take() the copies
 *    - if you want to have a class which contains cOwnedObject-subclasses as
 *      data members: your class (the enclosing object) should own them --
 *      call take() from the constructor and drop() from the destructor.
